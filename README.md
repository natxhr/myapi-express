Welcome to my simple project! ðŸ˜Š This application is built using Express.js as the framework. It is an API application that has been built using the GET, PUT, DELETE methods. The application is organized in a single file index.js where all the code is written. If you want to explore a basic application in Express.js, this project is a great example to start with.
